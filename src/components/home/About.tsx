          contains all carbon offset projects, credit issuances, and 
          credit retirements listed globally by five major voluntary 
          offset project registriesâ€”American Carbon Registry (ACR), 
          Climate Action Reserve (CAR), Gold Standard, Verra (VCS) and 
          Architecture for REDD+ Transactions (ART). These five registries 
          generate almost all of the world's voluntary market offsets and 
          also include credits eligible for use under the California / 
          Quebec linked cap-and-trade programs and Washington's cap-and-invest 
          program.
