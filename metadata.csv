Column Header,Details & Description,Data sourced directly from registry records,
project_id,The identification number given by the registries.,yes,
project_name,Name of the project on the registry.,yes,
voluntary_registry,The carbon credit registry that issues and tracks the credits.,,
arb_wa_project,"ARB Compliance or ARB Early Action = projects listed on the ARB's Issuance & Retirements table, WA = Project Listed on the Washington's Ecology Offsets Issuance table, No = all other projects; this can include ARB- and WA-eligible projects that have not yet transitioned into the ARB and WA project lists",,

scope,Each project falls under a scope according to the definitions in this document.,,
type,Each project is categorized by a type according to the definitions in this document.,,
reduction_removal,"Each project type is categorized as: Reductions, Impermanent removals, Long-duration removals, or Mixed. Reductions make up the majority of credits to date and are projects that reduce the amount of emissions entering the atmosphere. Removals are project types that primarily draw carbon out of the atmosphere. Mixed are project types that can generate both emissions reductions and carbon removals; ACR separates some projects into their reduction and removal components (see column Verified Removal of ACR Issuances.csv). Projects that capture and sequester emissions from a smoke stack or other human activity are considered reductions, since they are effectively reducing emissions, except if the emissions are from a renewable source like renewable biomass, in which case the project is considered removals.",,
methodology_protocol,"Defines the eligibility, emissions calculations methods, and monitoring requirements for specific project types. Methodologies can be found at the links included on READ FIRST. Methodology is synonymous with protocol. We harmonize the methodology name using the methodology_mapping dictionary, which you can find on our GitHub.",,
methodology_version,"Methodology version if listed. If a project uses more than one methodology, any listed versions are separated by commas and in the order that the methodologies are listed.",,
region,"Regions are defined in the World Regions tab using United Nations Statistics Division classifications. International shipping projects not registered in any particular country are categorized as ""International,"" as are projects spanning multiple countries.",,

project_developer,"The person or organization responsible for developing the carbon project. This is often the facility owner, project owner, or offset consultant.",yes,
total_credits_issued,"The total number of credits issued by the registry from the start of the project. Complete raw registry issuance tables are available on our GitHub. As of v6, issuance figures do not include buffer pool credits. Issuance figures also do not include Gold Standard planned emissions reductions (PERs) which are ex-ante credits representing expected future reductions. These are summed separately. Note that issued credit totals for VCS include all credits in a vintage if any credits of that vintage have been issued. This is different from how VCS reports issuances (please see the FAQ tab for a more detailed description).",,
total_credits_retired,"The total number of credits retired or canceled from the start of the project. Credits are marked as retired once an owner notifies the registry that credits are being used towards a compliance or voluntary emissions target. Once this happens, the credits can no longer be sold to another buyer. Details on retirements and cancellations, including credit serial numbers and sometimes the account holder retiring the credits, can be found in the raw registry retirements and cancellations tables. Note that Gold Standard designates some credits as 'assigned.' Assigned credits indicate the intention to use the credit for offsetting claims in the future. Most of these credits are afforestation and reforestation projects issuing credits from future sequestration; we include assigned credits in the retirement tallies.",,
total_credits_remaining,"The difference between credits issued and credits retired by vintage (the year when the reduction/removals occurred). Not all credits remaining are available for purchase, since some buyers may use them towards a climate commitment without notifying the registry or may be holding them for future use or resale. As of v6, buffer pool credits put aside by registries to cover the risk of reversals from forestry and other land use projects are excluded from this column.",,
total_buffer_pool_deposits,"All registries maintain a buffer pool of credits set aside as insurance against the risk that carbon credits generated by projects that involve carbon storage, such as forests and grasslands, are released back into the atmosphere. For each project, this column aggregates buffer pool credits deposited across all issuance years. Values take into account buffer pool adjustments, such as when credits are transitioned from the registry to ARB with different quantities of credits issued or deposited into the ARB buffer pool and when buffer pool credits are returned to the project as issuances. Credits used to cover reversals are not deducted from this buffer pool tally.",,
reversals_covered_by_buffer_pool,Total buffer pool credits used in compensation for a reversal by the project.,,
reversals_not_covered_by_buffer,"Issued credits used in compensation for a reversal by the project. ARB, Gold, and Verra do not allow for the buffer pool to cover intentional reversals—losses caused by events under the control of the project proponent. All reversals listed in this column need to be replaced by the project proponent.",,
buffer_credits_released_to_project,Total buffer credits returned to the project developer as issuances. E.g. VCS allows some buffer credits to be converted into issuances over time for projects that never experience a reversal.,,
first_year_of_project_vintage,The first vintage year when credited reductions/removals occurred.,,
credits_issued_by_vintage_year_[year],"Credits issued by year when reductions/removals occurred. To see the year when credits were issued, refer to the Credits Issued by Issuance Year columns. Issuances for ARB projects are calculated from registry and ARB issuances, except for VCS-ARB compliance projects sourced only from the ARB Issuances & Retirements table.",,
credits_retired_or_cancelled_[year],"Credits retired/canceled by the retirement/cancellation year. Retirements from ARB projects account for voluntary retirements listed in the registries as well as compliance retirements listed in ARB’s issuance table. ARB retirements occur in 2014, 2017, and 2020 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd compliance periods respectively, the 4th compliance period retired credits in 2022, 2023, and 2024.

registry_arb_wa,"For filtering and sorting purposes, ARB projects listed on ARB Issuance & Retirements table are listed in this column as “ARB” rather than by the registry that initially issued the credits. WA projects listed on the WA Issuances table are listed in this column as “WA.”",,
arb_wa_status,"Some projects from the ACR, CAR, and Verra registries are also registered under the California Air Resources Board’s (ARB’s) or Washington's (Ecology) offset programs. These projects can generate credits that meet regulatory requirements for use by regulated emitters to comply with the states' cap-and-trade requirements. These projects use ARB- or Ecology-approved compliance protocols or were accepted as early action projects in the early years of the ARB offset program. Note that some ARB early action projects are listed by CAR and ACR as ""ineligible"" as a compliance project.",yes,
arb_wa_id,ARB and Ecology assigned each of their projects their own ID number.,yes,
poa_aggregate_id,"Some registries allow multiple similar projects to participate as a group to reduce transaction costs. This column lists the ID for the umbrella project. Gold Standard calls the umbrella project a PoA (Programme of Activities) which can include many individual VPAs (Verified Project Activities). Gold Standard lists the PoA number for most VPAs. For projects that Gold Standard designates as a VPA without listing the PoA number we include ""VPA"" in this column in blue.
